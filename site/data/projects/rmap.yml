  RMAP tries to improve the strangely difficult task of choosing your new phone. It does this by letting the user set a budget and narrow-down their search with a simple set of powerful filters. The site is built with React and the search is powered by Elastic Search over AWS lambda. It make take a few seconds to load as it is pretty much archived and currently running on heroku free-tier, which sleeps apps when not in use.
