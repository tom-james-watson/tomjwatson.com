  An electron-based desktop app for macOS and Windows that will set a new piece of fine art as your desktop background every day.  The app also provides the ability to purchase a reproduction print of any artwork you like via the website.  The app and website are powered by an API that sits on top a custom curated database of Artists/Artworks and >250GB of art.  All the planning, designing and development of the app and website are done by me, as well as the creating of the art database and the curation of featured artworks.
