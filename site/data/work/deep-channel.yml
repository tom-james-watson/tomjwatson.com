  I was the first engineer on Deep Channel Studio, a comprehensive data IDE for working with warehouses, dbt projects, and notebooks. The IDE is an electron application built in Typescript. I took the initial vision and developed it into a usable MVP. I have since helped grow the team out and and am currently leading ongoing development of the application.
