  I worked as a remote contractor for Conversocial for 3 years, during which time the comapny grew from a small startup of ~20 employees into a successful and established company. I helped develop their Python platform that processes tens of millions of social posts per day, using technologies such as MongoDB and ElasticSearch. Frontend work included rebuilding their customer-facing web app as a modern React application and creating a proof-of-concept React Native application for a project in collaboration with Google.
